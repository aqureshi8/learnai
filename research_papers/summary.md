# Abstract
- DeepSeek-R1-Zero
    - Trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning
    - Strong reasoning capabilities
    - Challenges
        - Poor readability
        - Language Mixing
- DeepSeek-R1
    - Multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL
    - Improved reasoning
    - Addresses DeepSeek-R1-Zero challenges
