# Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning technique based on trial-and-error
- Uses rewards and punishment feedback for each action to learn
- Capable of delayed gratification
    - e.g. Short term sacrifices necessary for best strategy in long 

## Benefits
- Good for Complex Environments
    - model-free RL algorithm can adapt quickly to changing environment for optimal results
- Less Human Interaction Needed
    - RL algorithm learns by itself without need for human labeled data
    - human feedback can be accepted
- Optimizes for long term goals
    - long term reward maximization
